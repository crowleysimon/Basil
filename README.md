A small app designed for saving, tagging, searching, and viewing recipes found on the web

Small app to showcase dagger dependency injection, MVP architecture, RxJava, and unit testing. 
Allows the user to enter the web url for a recipe and generates data from it, the user can also rate and tag the recipe before storing it.
The user can then browse and search through the stored recipe and view them from within the app.
